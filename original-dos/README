			      Hello out there ! 		


     My name is Karg , I'm 19 years old and I am student in Timisoara-Romania,
     where I study electrical engineering . I begin to code games since 1990 , 
     first working on BASIC for ZX SPECTRUM (by the way,do you remember ?) .
     In 1991 , my school buy some 286 and I managed to learn Pascal,assembler,
     and C . In my spare time (24 hours - sleep time - school time - lunch time)
     I worked on my father's computer so in 1992 I finish my first PC game which
     was PLOTTING ( a remake after a SPECTRUM game of OCEAN-TAITO-TWILIGHT ).
     Then I coded ARMAGEDON (another remake after '83 OCEAN game ) and DEFENDER
     (which isn't in this demo , as I haven't time to finish it because I had 
     some exams) . In april 1995 , I managed to buy a computer (a 386 DX-40) 
     and I create PUZZLE( may 1995 ) , CUT! ( remake after ZOLYX-another SPECTRUM
     game - november 1995 ) and DEFLECTOR ( remake after a VORTEX game on SPECTRUM-
     december 1995) . 
     
     All games are written in TurboPascal. 	

     Some of the games have digital sounds if you have a SoundBlaster or 
     compatible (I test on a SoundGalaxy and it worked ) and add parameter D=64 
     in Config.sys if you're using EMM386 or DMA=64 if you're using QEMM. 	 		
	
     You are allowed to do whatever you like with my games - this is FREEWARE.
     You can distribute them freely , so everybody should enjoy them .
